# Graph-Theory-Sketcher
Final project for CPT_S/MATH 453 at Washington State University

## List of Features

### Tabs - Status: Completed
The user will be able to create different tabs, in which a single tab is a workspace for a single graph.
Tabs will consists of an editable name.

### Saving - Status: Completed
The user will be able to save and load tabs.

### Creating Nodes - Status: Completed
The user will be able to create nodes easily.

### Labeling Nodes - Status: Completed
The user will be able to attach labels to nodes

### Moving Nodes - Status: Completed
The user will be able to move nodes by clicking and dragging them.

### Drawing Edges - Status: Completed
The user will be able to draw edges between existing nodes.

### Looped Edges - Status: Planned
The program will support self connected edges (loops).

### Labeling Edges - Status: Completed
The user will be able to attach labels to edges.

### Scaling Edges and Nodes - Status: Completed
The user will be able to scale the size of edges and nodes.

### Curved Edges - Status: Planned
The user will be able to add and remove curves to edges by click on them
and selecting a bezier curve point halfway along the edge

### Edge Types - Status: Completed
The user will be able to toggle directedness of edges.

### Edge Weights - Status: Completed
The user will be able to give weights to edges.

### Toggling Labels - Status: Completed
The user will be able to toggle the visibility of all edge and node labels.

### Coloring Nodes - Status: Completed
The user will be able to give a node a unique color

### Coloring Edges - Status: Completed
The user will be able to give edges a unique color

### Stats - Status: Completed
There will be a HUD with the following stats visible at any time:
    * n - the number of vertices
    * m - the number of edges
    * k - the number of components

### Dijkstra's - Status: Completed
The user will be able to select any node, and see it's distance to any other node.

### Shortest Path - Status: Planned
The user will be able to select any 2 nodes, and see the shortest path between the 2.

### Bipartite-ness - Status: Planned
The user will be able to see if the graph is bipartite or not.

### Tree-ness - Status: Planned
The user will be able to see if the graph is a tree.

### Dual Graphs - Status: Stretch Goal
The user will be able to click a button that will open a new tab with the dual graph of the current tab.

### Physics - Status: Stretch Goal
The user will be able to toggle physics on, which will rearrange the graph into a physics-based object.
